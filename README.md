# Solidity_OpCodes
These are some Solidity OpCode exercises that Kingland Universtity has students doing for Homework exercises.
Some of these exercises are from Kingsland University's MI3 Solidity Optimizations video's where they help you understand some OP-Codes in Solidity.
Op-codes are operational codes that Solidity uses to save on gas fee's using the smart contract network.
