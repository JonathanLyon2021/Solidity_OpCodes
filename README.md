# Solidity_OpCodes
These are some Solidity OpCode exercises that Kingland Universtity has students doing for Homework exercises.
Some of these exercises are from Kingsland University's MI3 Solidity Optimizations video's where they help you understand some OP-Codes in Solidity.
Op-codes are operational codes that Solidity language uses to save on gas fee's on the Ethereum network. These are all different files/ exercises in this repo. Each one is a diferent version of solidity Operational codes, which inevitably save gas fees on Ethereum's network. I have recently found out that these Op-codes are really non-existest in the Ethereum architechture, and that they are rarely used. So most likely I will not be using them in my Solidity code.  Thank you for viewing my repository.
