# Solidity_OpCodes
These are some Solidity OpCode exercises that Kingland Universtity has students doing for Homework exercises.
Some of these exercises are from Kingsland University's MI3 Solidity Optimizations video's where they help you understand some OP-Codes in Solidity.
Op-codes are operational codes that Solidity uses to save on gas fee's using the smart contract network. These are all different files/ exercises in this repo. Each one is a diferent version of solidity Operational codes, which inevitably save gas fees on Ethereum's network. Thank you for viewing my repository.
